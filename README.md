***The world war game***

Hi,
This is an AI game, its name is known as RISK. However, I changed the rules a little bit:
In my game, the lucky and the cubes are not a part of the game. The rules are:

1. The game begins when every player has the same number of countries and each country has the same number of armies.

2. In the first of every turn, the player who plays in this turn adds 5 armies to his countries. He can divide the armies in any way he chooses.

3. After the player divided the his 5 armies, he can pass armies from every country belongs to him, (if it has armies, of course) to every country which is a side country for the player's country. The armies passing can be used for three main targets:
    - Pass armies from one country which belongs to the player to another country
which belongs to him, so he can move forward and ◊êo be spread over a large area, *or* concentrate his armies in the same place.
    - Pass armies to an enemy's country *or* to a neutral country and conquer it - when the amount of the armies that the player passes bigger than the armies that the enemy's country has.
    - Pass armies to an enemy's country *or* to a neutral country and not conquer it - when the amount of the armies that the player passes minor than the armies that the enemy's country has.

4. at the end of every turn the user will click on the button which finishes his turn.

5. The looser id the player who doesn't have countries anymore (the second one is the winner).
